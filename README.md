# Drone-Marker-Detection

This Project aims to detect specific Drone landing marker. 
The drone is hovering over the air, looking for the corresponding marker on the ground. 
When it finds a marker, it lands at that location.
The basic code is the histogram of gradients & Support vector machine, which is an object detection technique in dlib.
Since you need to mount the code on the drone, the code is assumed to work on the CPU.
